# chacha20_circuit

This repository contains the source code and necessary files to implement chacha20 circuit using Halo2. 
This work solves a task that allows a prover to prove the knowledge of a message block m, while the message is given in an encrypted form.

To test the circuit, display the proof size and draw the layout:
```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Layout:
